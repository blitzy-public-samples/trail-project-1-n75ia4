   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

5. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Development Tools
- VS Code with recommended extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - TypeScript
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - GitLens
- Configure VS Code settings:
  ```json
  {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    }
  }
  ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
Follow GitFlow branching model:
- `main`: Production releases
- `develop`: Development integration
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Production hotfixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Commit Standards
Follow Conventional Commits specification:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding/modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Document complex logic with comments

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Minimum coverage: 80%
- Required for all new code
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

### Integration Testing
- API tests using Supertest
- Component integration tests
- E2E tests using Cypress
- Run integration tests:
  ```bash
  pnpm test:integration
  ```

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with k6
- Performance benchmarks:
  - Page load: < 2s
  - API response: < 500ms
  - Database queries: < 200ms
- Run performance tests:
  ```bash
  pnpm test:performance
  ```

## Security Guidelines

### Security Scanning
Required scans before submission:
- SAST: SonarQube
- DAST: OWASP ZAP
- Dependency scanning: Snyk
- Secret scanning: GitGuardian
- Run security checks:
  ```bash
  pnpm security:check
  ```

### Compliance Requirements
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- SOC 2 requirements
- GDPR compliance
- Security best practices:
  - Input validation
  - Output encoding
  - Authentication checks
  - Authorization validation
  - Secure communications
  - Audit logging

## Submission Process

### Pull Request Guidelines
1. Create feature/bugfix branch
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run all checks locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm verify
   ```
4. Push changes and create PR
5. Fill PR template completely
6. Request review from maintainers

### CI/CD Pipeline Checks
All PRs must pass:
- Build stage
  - Lint checks
  - Type checking
  - Build verification
- Test stage
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Coverage requirements
- Security stage
  - Dependency scanning
  - Code scanning
  - Secret detection
- Deploy stage
  - Environment validation
  - Smoke tests
  - Performance verification

### Review Process
1. Code review by 2+ maintainers
2. Security review for sensitive changes
3. Documentation review
4. Performance impact assessment
5. Accessibility compliance check
