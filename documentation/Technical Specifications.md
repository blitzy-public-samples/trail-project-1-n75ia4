# Technical Specifications

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Task Management System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to streamline task organization and enhance team collaboration across organizations. This system addresses the critical business challenges of fragmented task tracking, inefficient team communication, and lack of centralized project visibility. Targeting project managers, team members, department heads, and system administrators, the solution provides a unified platform for task creation, project organization, and team collaboration. The system is expected to improve team productivity by 30%, reduce communication overhead by 40%, and provide 100% visibility into project status and resource allocation.

# 7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## 7.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

### 7.1.1 Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant S as SSO Provider
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>F: Access Application
    F->>A: Redirect to Auth
    A->>S: Initiate SSO Flow
    S->>U: Present Login Form
    U->>S: Submit Credentials
    S->>A: Return Auth Token
    A->>D: Validate & Store Session
    A->>F: Return JWT
    F->>U: Grant Access
```

### 7.1.2 Authorization Matrix

| Role | Task Management | Project Access | User Management | System Config | Reports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
